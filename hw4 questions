. For Q1f, the result from equation (3) is totally different. How come?

. For Q2, I just take the average of those test scores?
. Why is the size of cv_error 5?
. For "Classification" validation, is it the same way? (MSE)
. LR got the minimum MSE, is that correct?


. Do we have to split the data into training and test set for Ridge and LASSO?
. For the small lambda and large lambda 
  just to show examples of test error from different lambdas?
. For Ridge and LASSO, Using MSE the best lambda?
