In this dataset Fertility, the first column, is the response variable, and the other variables are potential predictors. We will use several different statistical modeling techniques. The data set contains 47 rows (samples), split the data into training and test sets. Set the first 30 rows to training samples and the rows 31 through 47 as the test samples."
